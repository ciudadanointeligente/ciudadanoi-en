description: Del Dicho al Hecho is a study that puts together a detailed analysis of the promises established by the government and reviews the status of its legislative and administrative fulfillment of these. Aware of the difficulties that we as citizens face to exercise our right to demand accountability, our study intends to empower citizens and to contribute to the reduction of the information gap that today has complicated an effective process of overseeing  our representatives.
