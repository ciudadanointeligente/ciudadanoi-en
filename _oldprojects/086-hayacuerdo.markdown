proj_description: This website was created to democratize discussions that are currently occurring in our country about cross-cutting themes and impacting citizens. It looks to reveal government proposals and compare them - in simple language and terminology - with the stances of the different social actors, in order to inform citizens about current discussions and to strengthen a greater participation in them.
